## üìÅ Contents

### ‚úÖ `consensus_simulation.html`
A simulation that visually demonstrates how different consensus mechanisms select validators:

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners compete based on computational power.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on stake.
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Token holders vote for delegates to validate blocks.

**Features:**
- Dynamic generation of validators.
- Visual selection of winners for each mechanism.
- Comparison table for PoW, PoS, and DPoS.
- Console-style log for internal logic.

### ‚úÖ `nonce_mining_simulation.html`
A live simulation of **Proof-of-Work** mining to demonstrate the mining process:

- Set **difficulty** (number of leading zeros in hash) and block data.
- Watch mining in real-time as the nonce is incremented until a valid hash is found.

**Outputs:**
- Total nonce attempts.
- Mining duration (seconds).
- Hash rate (hashes per second).
- Final block details: data, nonce, hash.

**Controls:**
- Start mining
- Stop mining
- Reset to start over

### ‚úÖ `blockchain_simulation.js.html`
A blockchain integrity demonstration:

- Initializes a chain with 3 blocks.
- Allows tampering with data of block 1.
- Visualizes the impact of tampering on the entire chain (invalid blocks turn red).
- Option to recompute hashes to fix the chain.

**Features:**
- Live rendering of blockchain with block details.
- Visual status: valid (green) or invalid (red).
- Tampering simulation to illustrate immutability.
